## [3.1.0] - 02-06-2025

### Added

- Import template for account entitlements.
- Import template for group entitlements.
- Added code flow for reconciliation resolutions based on `$actionContext.Origin`.

## [3.0.0] - 24-04-2025

### Added
- Introduced release workflows and issue templates in the `.github` directory. Publishing this folder triggers **two** GitHub Actions that will _automatically_ create a new release upon PR completion.
- Added an `AddRange` method to the `customList` class in `debugStart.ps1`, enabling the addition of multiple `auditLogs` to `$outputContext` during debugging sessions.
- Introduced an `email` property to `fieldMapping.json`, which defaults to `MicrosoftActiveDirectory.mail`.
- Included an example for `AccountReference` in the README.
- Implemented a **MultipleFound** validation for `$correlatedAccount` in `create.ps1`.

### Changed
- Updated the message shown when an account cannot be located.
- Revised the features table in the README for improved clarity on the connector's capabilities.
- Adjusted the default value of `retrievedPermission` in the permission script to better align with HelloID behavior.
- Updated auditLogs in the grant and revoke scripts to use `$actionContext.PermissionDisplayName`.

### Removed
- Removed the `displayName` field from the permission reference in the permission script.

### Changed

- Updated the correlation values in the _create_ script.

## [2.0.0] - 25-07-2024

### Added
 - Added a default ActionContext.json to use in the DebugStart script. This provides test data for local debugging and can be directly extracted from HelloID, ensuring consistent object handling locally and in HelloID

### Changed
 - Moved the processing DryRun block one level closer to the actual web call. To skip only the web call in the target system in preview mode. To remove the difference between a preview run and actual enforcement. And test more connector code in Preview mode.
 - Changed the debugStart to use ActionContext.json instead of Powershell Object.
 - Some textual improvements.
 - Moved explicit DryRun messages for preview mode, to the `else` condition after the (-not dryrun block).

### Removed

- Removed Person.DisplayName from logging.
- Removed Start EndDate from FieldMapping.

## [1.2.0] - 18-04-2024

### Changed

- Renamed the header in file `grantPermission.ps1` from 'Grant' to  'GrantPermission-Group' to match the file name and folder change.
- Renamed the header in file `revokePermission.ps1` from 'Revoke' to  'RevokePermission-Group' to match the file name and folder change.
- Renamed the header in file `permissions.ps1` from 'Permissions' to  'Permissions-Group' to match the file name and folder change.
- Renamed the header in file `resources.ps1` from 'Resources' to  'Resources-Group' to match the file name and folder change.

- Moved the following files to the _permissions/groups_ folder:
  - grantPermission.ps1
  - revokePermission.ps1
  - permissions.ps1

- Moved the following file to the _resources/groups_ folder:
  - resources.ps1

- Converted the properties of both `$correlatedAccount` and `$desiredAccount` in the `update.ps1` lifecycle action to arrays _@()_ for consistent handling.

- Changed logic and flow in both `grantPermission.ps1` and `revokePermission.ps1` lifecycle actions.
  - Modified the condition to check if `$correlatedAccount` is not null before determining the action _GrantPermission_ or _NotFound_ and constructing the corresponding message.
  - Added `switch` statement to handle the different actions.
  - Adjusted the log message inside the `$actionContext.DryRun -eq $true` block to use the constructed `$dryRunMessage`.
  - Adjusted the dryRun information message to display `$actionContext.References.Permission.DisplayName` instead of `$actionContext.References.Permission.Reference`.
  - Adjusted the information message inside the `if (-not($actionContext.DryRun -eq $true))` block to display both the `$actionContext.References.Permission.DisplayName` and `$actionContext.References.Permission.Reference`.
  - Renamed 'entitlement' to 'permission' to be consistent in all informational and audit messages.
