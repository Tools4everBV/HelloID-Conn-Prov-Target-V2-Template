## Before making contributions

Keep in mind that each application is unique and may require specific code to be written to interact with its API or database schema. Because of this, it's generally not a good idea to include too much generic code in the connector template.

> [!TIP]
> It's important to avoid writing code that assumes a certain structure or behavior of the target application. Instead, a good approach is to provide a solid foundation for the connector template and leave it up to the developer to modify and adapt the code to fit the specific needs of their implementation.

Ultimately, the goal of the PowerShell connector templates is to provide a starting point for anyone building their own custom connector, and it's important to strike a balance between providing helpful structure and guidance, while also allowing for flexibility and customization.

## How can I contribute?

### Bug report
🪲

To submit a new issue, navigate to the `Issues` tab on the repository page and click the `New Issue` button. Describe the issue in as much detail as possible, including any error messages or steps to reproduce the issue. This will help the development team to diagnose and fix the problem.

### Feature request
🚀

To request a new feature, create a new issue using the same process as for a bug report. Be sure to describe the feature you would like to see added, and explain how it would improve your experience.

### Code changes

If you would like to contribute code changes to the templates, you can do so by creating a pull request on the repository. Be sure to fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes. Once you have made your changes, create a pull request and describe the changes you have made and why they are necessary. Your changes will be reviewed by the development team, and if accepted, merged into the main branch of the repository.
