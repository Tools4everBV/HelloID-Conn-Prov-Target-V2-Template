## Best practices

Best practices not only ensure the quality of your code, but also helps to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of your development processes.
By adhering to these best practices, you will develop a PowerShell connector that is reliable, efficient, and easy to maintain.

### Keep it simple
Write code that is easy to read and maintain. This means:

-  Use clear and concise variable names.
-  Use consistent formatting throughout your scripts.
-  Avoid unnecessary loops and other code constructs that can slow down your script.

### Fit-For-Purpose

We believe in a _Fit for Purpose_ (FFP) approach to development, which means that we only build what is needed and nothing more.

There are several compelling reasons why we encourage __you__ to adopt a _Fit for Purpose_ approach to development:

1. __Greater efficiency and effectiveness__ <br> By focusing only on the features and functions that are necessary for a given implementation, you can create connectors that are highly efficient and effective, without having to deal with unnecessary complexity or overhead.

2. __Increased customer satisfaction__ <br> By tailoring connectors to the specific needs of each customer, you can create solutions that better meet their expectations and requirements. This can lead to increased customer satisfaction and a better overall customer experience.

3. __Lower costs__ <br> By building only what is needed, you can avoid unnecessary development costs and reduce the time and effort required to create a connector.

4. __Improved scalability__ <br> By taking a modular approach to development, you can create connectors that are easily modified or expanded as needed. This can make it easier to scale the connector as the customer's needs change over time.

5. __Reduced risk__ <br> By focusing only on the features and functions that are necessary, you can reduce the risk of introducing bugs or other issues into the connector. This can lead to greater stability and reliability.

### __Test__ and __Production__ mode

The `$actionContext.DryRun` variable is used to distinguish between a provisioning job running in __test__ (commonly referred to as __Preview__ mode), or __production__ mode.

We consider it a good practice, to _only_ use the test mode, to validate an account, generate names and perform contract calculations.

In other words, when running in __test__ mode, you will see what would happen with a _person account_ during an actual enforcement.

### Logging

With provisioning connectors, we typically differentiate between __verbose__ logging, which contains the full error returned by the API, and __audit__ logging, which contains a more user-friendly response.

| Cmdlet / HelloID variable  | Description                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Write-Warning`            | - Use in case of an error.<br> - Include the script line number and code where the error has occurred. <br> - Must contain the complete error record |
| `Write-Information`        | - Debug logging only.                                                                                                                                |
| `$outputContext.AuditLogs` | - Must contain a more __user-friendly__ error message                                                                                                |

>[!TIP]
Don’t use the audit logging for verbose or debugging logging. Only write an audit log if the lifecycle action itself has failed.

### Do not retrieve all users within a lifecycle action

Some APIs do not provide the option to retrieve a single object, but instead only offer an __HTTP.GET__ endpoint that retrieves all objects.

When the target application contains a large number of records, operations like these can take a considerable amount of time and are not well-suited for any of the lifecycle actions. In such cases, it is preferable to use a resource script instead.

### Always GET the account

In all life cycle actions, the initial step is to validate whether the account exists. Depending on the outcome of this validation, the appropriate action will be executed.

Please refer to the code following [action logic code example](#action-logic-example) for an example on how this is implemented in the `create` lifecycle action.

#### Action logic example

```powershell
 # Verify if a user must be either [created and correlated] or just [correlated]
$correlatedAccount = 'The user object from the target system'
if ($null -eq $correlatedAccount){
    $action = 'CreateAccount'
    $outputContext.AccountReference = 'Currently not available'
} else {
    $action = 'CorrelateAccount'
    $outputContext.AccountReference = $correlatedAccount.id
}

# Add a message and the result of each of the validations showing what will happen during enforcement
if ($actionContext.DryRun -eq $true) {
    Write-Information "[DryRun] $action {connectorName} account for: [$($personContext.Person.DisplayName)], will be executed during enforcement"
}

# Process
if (-not($actionContext.DryRun -eq $true)) {
    switch ($action) {
        'CreateAccount' {
            Write-Information 'Creating and correlating {connectorName} account'

            # Make sure to test with special characters and if needed; add utf8 encoding.

            $outputContext.AccountReference = ''
            $outputContext.AccountCorrelated = $true
            $auditLogMessage = "Create account was successful. AccountReference is: [$($outputContext.AccountReference)"
            break
        }

        'CorrelateAccount' {
            Write-Information 'Correlating {connectorName} account'
            $outputContext.AccountReference = ''
            $outputContext.AccountCorrelated = $true
            $auditLogMessage = "Correlated account: [$($correlatedAccount.ExternalId)] on field: [$($correlationField)] with value: [$($correlationValue)]"
            break
        }
    }

    $outputContext.success = $true
    $outputContext.AuditLogs.Add([PSCustomObject]@{
        Action  = $action
        Message = $auditLogMessage
        IsError = $false
    })
}
```

#### If the managed account does not exist

On certain occasions, the managed account may inadvertently be removed from the target system, resulting in a failure of the lifecycle action. To ensure that the lifecycle action always continues, it is necessary to validate if the target account is present. Nevertheless, in some scenarios, even if the account cannot be found, the result of the action __will__ be flagged as `success`.

The table below provides an overview of the results when the target account may inadvertently be removed from the target system.

| Lifecycle action | Result  | Description                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Delete           | Success | The target account may inadvertently be removed, however, this is considered a successful outcome by HelloID.                                                         |
| Disable          | Success | The target account may have been inadvertently removed; consequently, it is no longer active. HelloID considers this to be an acceptable outcome.                     |
| Enable           | Fail    | The target account has been deleted; however, this was not the anticipated outcome for HelloID.                                                                       |
| Update           | Fail    | The target account has been deleted; however, this was not the anticipated outcome for HelloID.                                                                       |
| Grant            | Fail    | The target account has been deleted; however, this was not the anticipated outcome for HelloID.                                                                       |
| Revoke           | Success | Due to the account not existing anymore, the right is no longer granted. This is in accordance with the request by HelloID, and therefore it is recorded as a success |

### Updating accounts

When it comes to updating accounts in the target system, we take a careful and methodical approach. One of our key best practices is to always compare the target system account with the HelloID account object before making any updates. This allows us to ensure that we're only updating the necessary fields.

It's worth noting that the underlying data types for the account object in the target system may differ from the account object in HelloID. This can make it challenging to perform an accurate comparison between the two. If the data types are not aligned, it may be necessary to perform additional steps to ensure that the comparison is meaningful and that the appropriate actions are taken.

> [!NOTE]
> It's important to note that the current compare logic only works for flat objects, and not for complex objects that, for example, contain nested arrays. This means that you will need to make adjustments to this logic depending on the specific requirements of the target system.

### `$outputContext.Data` vs `$outputContext.PreviousData`

In addition to [Updating accounts](#updating-accounts) the same applies to the comparison between the `$outputContext.Data` and `$outputContext.PreviousData`.

This comparison between `$outputContext.Data` vs `$outputContext.PreviousData` is built-in within _HelloID_.<br> When a difference is found, The _update_ lifecycle action will be triggered and an audit log will be shown. If both objects are equal, no lifecycle action will be triggered and no audit log will be shown.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently you will need to ensure that the `$outputContext.PreviousData` object contains the exact same properties as the `$outputContext.Data` and ultimately the `$actionContext.Data`.<br> If these objects are not the same, a difference will be detected. For example; if the target account contains an `id` or `createdDate`.

## Debugging

Debugging is _arguably_ one of the most complex topics in any programming / scripting language.

The templates also comes with a __debugStart.ps1__, __config.json__ and __demoPerson.json__ in the _test_ folder. They allows you to easily debug your scripts. You can _mock_ variables such as the `$personContext`, `$actionContext` and all built-in variables in HelloID you need. By mocking these variables, you can easily test your scripts under a variety of conditions, without having to worry about external dependencies or data sources.

To mock a variable in `debugStart.ps1`, simply specify the value you want to use for that variable in the mock object at the top of the script.

> [!NOTE]
> Note that, most variables are already specified with a default value.

To start debugging your code from VSCode:

1. Select the code in the: `debugStart.ps1` and press: `F8` - _Run selection_ to add the variables to your PowerShell session.
2. Open up a lifecycle action and set a breakpoint somewhere in your code.
3. Press: `F5` or click: `Run -> Start Debugging` to start a new debugging session.

> [!CAUTION]
> Never hardcode sensitive information like usernames, passwords, or API keys directly in your code. Instead, use secure methods for storing and retrieving these credentials.

### When performance matters

#### Profiler

_Profiler_ is a PowerShell module that originated from `Measure-Script`. _Profiler_ can be installed directly from the PSGallery by running: `Install-Module profiler` directly in your PowerShell console.

#### SpeedScope

SpeedScope is a web viewer for performance profiles and can be downloaded from: https://github.com/jlfwong/speedscope/releases

_Profiler_ can generate flame graphs that can be viewed using _SpeedScope_.

## Security and compliance

- __Avoid Hardcoding Credentials__<br>
Never hardcode sensitive information like usernames, passwords, or API keys directly in your code. Instead, use secure methods for storing and retrieving these credentials.

- __Minimize Exposure__<br>
Implement robust error handling to minimize the exposure of sensitive information in error messages or logs.

- __Peer Reviews__<br>
Conduct thorough code reviews, especially focusing on areas where sensitive information is handled. Multiple sets of eyes can help identify potential security risks.

- __Have a Plan__<br>
Develop an incident response plan in case of a security breach. Be prepared to notify users and take necessary actions promptly.

## Other useful VSCode extensions

There are several useful VSCode extensions that can be helpful when building PowerShell connectors. Here are a few examples:

- __PowerShell__<br>https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.PowerShell<br>
